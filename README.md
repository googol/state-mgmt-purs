# state-mgmt-purs

I will write some purescript versions of the state management session challenge, with the popular libraries.

## Requirements for building
You will need to install the latest purescript compiler, pulp and bower.
See the [purescript homepage](http://www.purescript.org/) for installation instructions.

## Pux
To build, change to the `pux` directory.
Install dependencies with `bower install`.
Run `./build.sh` to start the compiler in watch mode.
Then simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.
